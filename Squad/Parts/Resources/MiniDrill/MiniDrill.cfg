description = A smaller version of the popular Drill-O-Matic, this drill is designed to help extract valuable resources from the crust of planets and asteroids.  Unlike it's larger cousin, this smaller model is only suitable for ore concentrations in excess of 2.5%.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.
