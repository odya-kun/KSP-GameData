			TyloFlyingLowCave = While making a pass over the cave, all radio emissions seem to drop to zero, curious given Jool's normally high levels of background radio noise.
			TyloFlyingLowFace = The faint outlines of some kind of face-like object are visible on the surface here. Curiously, it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to Kerbal faces.
			BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The initial visual observation is difficult to believe at first glance. Signs of extraterrestrial biological life? An explanation for the unseen, lurking menace felt by all Kerbalnauts? Some kind of elaborate hoax? Closer study is warranted...
			BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The round cleft (a mouth of some kind?) glows brightly in a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. One can only hope that nothing will ever pry open that menacing cavity.
			BobFlyingLowDeadKraken = Observations show what can only be described as some kind of kraken, a Space Kraken if you will, lying on the surface of Bop. Dead, one can only hope...
			BopFlyingLowDeadKraken = Significant emissions of UV and X-ray radiation are detected. Observe caution when making any closer approaches to the entity.

Those rumours have never been proven however, and this mysterious blue propellant has yet to be seen by a reliable source. Despite their repeated attempts to be rid of these rumours, the company still suffers from a (probably undeserved) bad reputation. They try to offset this initial impression by offering much larger cash payoffs than other companies of similar size, which admittedly does very little to improve their current image.

		description = Research into feasible ways to slow down a plane in mid-air showed that loose hull panels are pretty great as drag-inducing deceleration devices. The discovery led to the invention of the Aerodynamically Integrated Retrograde Braking Robustly Armed Kinetic Extending System (A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.), which is now popular mostly as a cheap alternative to longer runways. C7 Engineers are still trying to come up with a shorter name for such a long acronym.

		description = While the Kerbals at Mission Control were still figuring out how to get their rockets back down to Kerbin safely, the research engineers at FLOOYD were quickly realising that protecting parts on ascent was just as important. Heavy research into two-dimensional-input driven procedural construction was then funded with the hopes of making protective shells for important payloads and interstage areas of the crafts. The protective shells also have the benefit of making the craft more aerodynamic, hopefully saving on precious rocket fuel! The AE-FF3 is the largest size available from FLOOYD.

		title = Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large
		manufacturer = STEADLER Engineering Corps
		description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket engineers discovered that large flywheels were necessary to keep large ships under control. The "Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large" addresses that issue by its use of patented Large Flywheels™ to provide "More Torque" (patent pending). STEADLER promptly dismissed all criticism concerning the necessity of so much research work, stating that 'it only sounds so simple now that we've figured it out'. Critics remain skeptical, but none can disagree that this module does indeed pack a lot more punch than previous models. It also needs a lot more power, but STEADLER is currently carrying out intense research work on why that is.

This was met with divided opinions, some criticizing C7 as taking the "booooring" route, others praising them for the innovation, while yet others reacted by shutting themselves in bunkers in anticipation of the time when these units will gain sentience and turn on their creators. C7 has vehemently denied any involvement in all sentient-AI-related catastrophes so far.

Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, many engineers have found it to be ideally suited for those 'optional return' missions.

Its internal battery supply is also very limited, being intended mainly to keep the Standby LEDs lit.

After the recall of the FTX-1 series, All FTX-2 lines have arrows painted on to indicate the fuel flow direction, so engineers can tell which way around they are supposed to go.

This new model features the latest in thrust vectoring and compression technology and is designed to operate best at higher altitudes and speeds. The advanced turbo ramjet design bleeds air around the compressor at high speed allowing a far maximum speed than regular jet engines, so engineers from C7 Aerospace assured us all those leaks are intentional.

		description = Kerbodyne's flagship engine, the KS-25 excels as a first stage engine through its high thrust-to-weight ratio and exceptional sea level efficiency. Kerbodyne engineers achieved this by running the engine in a staged combustion cycle and at extremely high chamber pressures. Special new alloys had to be invented to suppress the engine's tendency to become a bomb. The single version is designed with very durable components and high reusability, as well as higher gimbal range, but because of that is also heavier than its expendable counterpart used in first stage clusters.

Instead of relying on single engines or solid rocket boosters, the KR-1x2 employs two modified KR-1 engine, fed by a built-in fuel system, as the source of its immense lifting power. All that self-contained goodness comes at the cost of not having a mounting point for its underside, and not being quite as efficient as dedicated engines. It also comes at quite a literal cost as well.

The engineers couldn't get it to produce full efficiency at sea level without the engine exploding, so it was repurposed as an upper stage engine. The experience gained here with high efficiency has been repurposed for later models, which feature multiple combustion chambers at higher pressure (that don't go boom). This engine is optimized for lighting mid-flight, although it still provides respectable power at sea level.

		manufacturer = Kerbodyne
		description = Kerbodyne engineers got fed up with having to contend with overly complicated staging arrays for lifting heavy payloads, and decided instead to just build a truly enormous engine of the highest efficiency. Strapping together four of Kerbodyne's KS-25 rocket motors in a single assembly, they created the largest rocket engine in production anywhere, and each KS-25 has the highest chamber pressure--the reason for four small nozzles and combustion chambers, not one big one (those kept going boom). It's certainly got the power to match its size, and although it excels in its main role as a first-stage engine, the lack of structural hardpoints on its underside makes it quite less suitable for other purposes. Its price tag also seems to match its size, in fact.

These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel+Oxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They are fairly more bulky in comparison though, and feature only one nozzle facing outwards, although most agree that is an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.

This initial reaction was only put aside when the amount of fiery explosions in assembly areas became so high, strict guidelines were put in place to prohibit "teasing the fuel containers". The T200 Tank now is widely used in several space programs and does a remarkably good job, if assembled politely.

This eliminates the need for a Splitter plate, while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic to subsonic speeds. DSIs can be used to replace the intake ramp and inlet cone, which are more complex, heavy and expensive.

Needless to say, this part may very well herald a revolution in construction technologies. Docking ports sold separately.

After observing an intern cleaning out his shoes by turning them upside and shaking them inside the lab, our team was hit with a stroke of inspiration! Why not turn the rocket parts upside down and shake them? The grabbing arm perfectly filled this niche, and is quite capable of lifting heavy machinery. It has since found other uses, besides delicate tool extraction operations. AKA "The Klaw!"

While OMB Demolition has been criticized in the past for using "big fancy words for a rocket holder" in their description of their device, none can say the TT18 series doesn't deliver rock-solid clamping action, as advertised. The owner's manual strongly suggests these devices be placed on the bottommost section of the spacecraft, and activated as soon as the engines are lit, for optimal de-clamping performance.

Even though many Kerbal physicists still dispute the validity of this new law, studies show that the thrusters seem to work as advertised.

			MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
			MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface...
			GillyInSpace = It looks like a particularly lumpy rock. Bet you could jetpack down there.
			MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
			EveInSpace = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The shiny oceans are mesmerizing.

			LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You mark down the landmasses in your report.
			VallInSpace = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You do not think you'd like to try and land on them.
			VallInSpace = The moon is mostly white and lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
			TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more heavily cratered than the other.
			TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. For a second you thought you saw a face down there...
			BopInSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
			BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window. Is there something moving down there?
			PolInSpace = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
			PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
			EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
			EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other nearby planets.  You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.

			JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure how you even landed on the surface of a gas giant. But it's probably best not to think about it for too long.
			LaytheSrfLanded = This place seems nice and comfortable. So comfortable you feel like taking your helmet off. You check the box on your report for -Looks breathable-.
			LaytheSrfLanded = You take your helmet off... After a few long seconds of gasping and haphazardly flailing about you manage to secure your helmet again. You erase the checkbox on your report for breathable atmosphere.
			VallSrfLanded = The surface occasionally rumbles beneath you. You think you should probably get back to the ship.
			TyloSrfLanded = The gravity here is pretty comfortable and reminds you of home. However, the lack of atmosphere is a stark contrast to Kerbin.
			BopSrfLanded = The surface is very brown and lumpy. You poke at it with your glove and notice how hard it is.
			PolSrfLanded = Everywhere you look it appears the planet is sharp. You don't think you want to sit down or fall on anything.
			EelooSrfLanded = You lay down and give the planet a hug, just so it knows it's not alone out here.

			VallInSpace = Scanning from orbit provides a clearer picture of the internal makeup of Vall.
			VallSrfLanded = Scanning the surface details gravitational fluctuations in the shifting interior of the planet.
			TyloInSpace = The planet has lower gravity than anticipated. This will give our scientists information about the interior makeup of Tylo.
			TyloSrfLanded = Detailed scans hint at hollow spaces in the interior of the planet.
			BopInSpace = Orbiting Bop allows for scans of the varied surface. Interesting stuff!
			BopSrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here...
			PolInSpace = The sensor picks up multiple layers under the surface of the planet.
			PolSrfLanded = Landing on the planet has allowed for highly detailed scans of the interior gravity on Pol.
			EelooInSpace = Though the surface appears to be smooth, there are fluctuations under the surface of the planet.
			EelooSrfLanded = Gravity scans are very clear here. There appears to be little influence from other bodies.

			KerbinSrfLanded = Temperature and Pressure readings suggest today is as good a time for flying as any.
			KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's very hot and dry out in the Deserts. The sensors were getting clogged up with dust.
			KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The polar atmosphere was found to be very, very cold indeed. Some sensors froze shut, but we're reasonably sure this is still air.
			MunSrf = Instruments detect a faint particulate aura around the surface. Not an atmosphere, but it may explain the reported lights on the horizon.
			MinmusSrf = There are detectable releases of gasses, but nothing that could be considered an atmosphere.
			DunaSrf = The atmosphere on Duna is very, very thin. It might be possible to fly in it with large enough wings, or a fast enough aircraft.

			DresSrf = There does not appear to be an atmosphere here.
			JoolFlyingHigh = The atmospheric pressures are very high here, and you detect a large number of gasses.
			JoolFlyingLow = The instrument is having trouble sampling at these densities. The gasses are beginning to liquify under pressure.
			JoolSrfLanded = The instrument has mostly compressed into an unrecognizable mass of metal.
			LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Laythe appears to be very similar to that of Kerbin. I wouldn't volunteer to go out first without a helmet on, however.
			LaytheSrfLanded = Taking your helmet off here probably won't kill you... very quickly.
			VallSrfLanded = There are traces of cryovolcanic compounds. But not a full atmosphere.
			TyloSrfLanded = There appear to be only faint traces of the heaviest isotopes on the surface.
			BopSrfLanded = The sensors detected organic compounds for a second. Possibly a mistake.
			BopSrfLanded = The sensors detect nothing out of the ordinary. Surely nothing could live here.
			PolSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere to speak of, but you sample the temperature anyways.
			EelooSrfLanded = There appears to be a tenuous atmospheric coating around the planet. But it is too thin to affect any spacecraft landing here.
