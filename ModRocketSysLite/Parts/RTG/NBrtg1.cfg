	description = A slightly larger, more heat tolerant source of consistent electrical power that can also double as a space heater inside of rovers, for the enterprising sojourner. This however is untested, so experiments may be required to sate the curiosity of intrepid pathfinders. Such an opportunity should not be wasted. That is the spirit of exploration, is it not?
