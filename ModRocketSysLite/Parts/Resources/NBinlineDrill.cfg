description = After finding some Kerbodyne drills that apparently fell off of a truck, MRS engineers decided to enclose them in cylindrical casings (also fallen from a truck), for ease of use. WARNING: Do not use as the root part of a vessel. Can result in vessel deletion due to a stock KSP issue with the drill.
